    Slide 1 - What is a Four Bridge Rectifier.
</h1>
    
    <p>
        The 4 bridge recitfier is a electronic circuit designed to convert AC (Alternating Current) into DC (Direct Current).

    <p>
        (I will teach about AC and DC in slide 2).
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Converting AC (Alternating Current) into DC (Direct Current) Is very inportant for devices that plug into wall outlets such as, laptop and phone chargers, 
        blenders, electric pianos, and other digital devices that are either constantly pluged into the wall or need to be charged every so often.
