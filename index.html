<!-- <p>Note below that there two ways to get to the new pages. One is called 
    relative and the other is using the root folder. Both ways work. It's 
    up to you to decide which you want to use.
    I find it simplist to use the relative folder approach so that you can 
    use the Visual Studio Code plugin called Live Server.
