    The bridge rectifier was an important invention to electronic history, that would later be very common in many electrical chargers and devices.
    In this Website I will give information about, what is a bridge rectifier, how the bridge rectifier works, and where bridge rectifiers are used.

<!-- <p>Note below that there two ways to get to the new pages. One is called 
    relative and the other is using the root folder. Both ways work. It's 
    up to you to decide which you want to use.
    I find it simplist to use the relative folder approach so that you can 
    use the Visual Studio Code plugin called Live Server.
